<!-- Thanks for reporting a problem for this project. READ THIS FIRST:

This issue template is meant to REPORT Nuki Hub PROBLEMS ONLY

Please DO NOT OPEN AN ISSUE:
  - If your Nuki Hub version is not the latest from the master branch, please update your device before submitting your issue. Your problem might already be solved. The latest precompiled binaries of Nuki Hub can be downloaded from https://github.com/technyon/nuki_hub/releases
  - If your issue has been addressed before (i.e., duplicated issue), please ask in the original issue

 Please take a few minutes to complete the requested information below. Our ability to provide assistance is greatly hampered without it. The details requested potentially affect which options to pursue. The small amount of time you spend completing the template will also help the volunteers providing the assistance to you to reduce the time required to help you.

DO NOT DELETE ANY TEXT from this template! Otherwise the issue will be auto-closed.
